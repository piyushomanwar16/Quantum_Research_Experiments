#  Quantum SVM Research — Classical vs Quantum Machine Learning on Wine Dataset

This repository contains the full implementation, experiments, and reproducible analysis for my research comparing **Classical Support Vector Machines (SVMs)** and **Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVMs)** using the Wine classification dataset.  
All experiments follow a reproducible pipeline with:

-  Multiple quantum feature maps  
-  Fidelity-based quantum kernels  
-  Classical baselines  
-  Noise simulations  
-  Kernel similarity analysis  
-  Complete visualizations & metrics  
-  A full automated analysis pipeline

This repository is structured like a publication-ready research project and is designed to help researchers, students, and practitioners reproduce the entire workflow.
