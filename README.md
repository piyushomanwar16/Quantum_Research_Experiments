# QSVM Experiment: Classical vs Quantum SVM on Wine Dataset

This repository contains the official implementation and reproducible workflow of my research comparing **Classical Support Vector Machines (SVMs)** and **Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVMs)** using Qiskit Machine Learning.

The goal of this repository is to provide:
- a clean and reusable implementation
- full experiment reproducibility
- cutting-edge QSVM techniques
- multiple feature maps (ZZ, Pauli, Custom Data Re-uploading)
- complete kernel matrices, confusion matrices, results, and plots
- a guided replication path for students and researchers
